# road_condition_detector_webapp
This repository contains a web-based application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow for detecting road conditions from images. The tool uses a pre-trained CNN model to classify road surfaces as either "Good road" or "Bad road", particularly focusing on rainy-day pothole detection scenarios.
